#as an initialization we have to read words.txt file to make it as our dataset and determine a random word from it. //ok
#first step, we need to implement [6][5] grid to make the user interface with it and guesses 6 words from Dataset every word contains 5 letters. //ok
#The second step the user has 6 tries to guess a word that will be randomly selected from the game (code). //ok
#We have 2 options first one that the user guessed a word not included in Dataset,so we have to set an error message that WORD NOT FOUND. //ok
#second one that the user guessed the correct word from dataset so we have to determine letters that included in random word chose by game by its index. ->> {Bonus according to color (Green ->> correct index,Yellow ->> close index,Gray ->> letter no included)}. //ok
#Game ends when user has guessed the word correctly before 6 tries or the user has finished his 6 tries or (additional property) ->> (user input is giveup). //ok
